#### By: Ryan Duff

## Description
A Todo List Application created with ASP.NET Core MVC. 

## Technologies Used
- C#
- ASP.NET Core MVC
- Razor Pages

## Setup/Installation Requirements
- Note: An installation of the .NET SDK is required in order to run this application locally. [See Here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/) for installation.
1. Clone this repo.
2. Open your shell (e.g., Terminal or GitBash) and navigate to this project's directory called "ryans_todo_from_section3/". 
3. Create a file named `appsettings.json`: `$ touch appsettings.json`
4. Within `appsettings.json` add the following code, replacing the `uid` and `pwd` values with your own username and password for MySQL.

    ```json
    {
      "ConnectionStrings": {
          "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=ryans_todo_from_section3;uid=[YOUR-USERNAME];pwd=[YOUR-MYSQL-PASSWORD];"
      }
    }
    ```
5. Set up the Database. Follow the instructions in the LearnHowToProgram.com lesson ["Creating a Test Database: Exporting and Importing Databases with MySQL Workbench"](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net/database-basics/creating-a-test-database-exporting-and-importing-databases-with-mysql-workbench) to use the `ryans_todo_from_section3.sql` file located at the top level of this repo to create a new database in MySQL Workbench with the name `ryans_todo_from_section3`.
6. Navigate to the project directory: `$ cd ToDoList`
7. Run `$ dotnet watch run` in the command line to start the project in development mode with a watcher.
8. Open the browser at: _https://localhost:5001_. If you cannot access localhost:5001 it is likely because you have not configured a .NET developer security certificate for HTTPS. To learn about this, review this lesson: [Redirecting to HTTPS and Issuing a Security Certificate](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net/basic-web-applications/redirecting-to-https-and-issuing-a-security-certificate).
